Air shower
    Consider the case where a $\tau$-neutrino gives birth to a $\tau$-lepton in ice, which
    travels for a distance and then decays in air. Charges will be produced in air,
    and because of the magnetic field of the Earth, *geomagnetic emission* takes
    place, and radio signal can be detected by the payload.

    This term also refers to in-air showers caused by cosmic rays, which produce
    radio waves that are horizonally polarized.

##  Cosmogenic Neutrinos

> " ...chemical composition  at Earth is still uncertain."

ie. We are not certain about the chemical composition of cosmic rays detected 
at Earth. It could be mostly protons or heavier nucleus (eg. iron).

> "...leading to significant uncertainties in predicted cosmogenic neutrino fluxes..."

ie. If UHECR consists mostly of protons, then more neutrinos would be generated.

Steradian
    The [dimensionless] unit of solid angle in SI units,
    much analogous to radian, which quantifies planar angles (Wikipedia).

Uniform source class
    This refers to the assumption that cosmic ray sources are more or less homogeneous in 
    space and in time.

## UHE Astrophysical Neutrinos

```{glossary}
GRB
    Gamma-ray burst.

FSRQ
    Flat-spectrum radio quasars are objects with emission-line dominated spectra.

Quasar
    A quasar is an extremely luminous AGN. It is sometimes know as a *quasi-stellar object*,
    or *QSO*. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar)

    neutrinos may appear **diffuse** or may be resolvable with **stacking searches**."

diffuse
    meaning?
