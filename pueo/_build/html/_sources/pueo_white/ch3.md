## In-Ice Askaryan Emission

```{glossary}
Shower
    In particle physics, a shower is a *cascade* of secondary particles produced
    as the result of a high-energy particle interacting with dense matter (Wikipedia).

Electromagnetic shower
    Denoted by $X$.

    > An EM shower begins when a high-energy electron, 
    positron or photon enters a material. At high energies,
    in which the photoelectric effect and Compton scattering are insignificant,
    photons interact with matter
    primarily via pair production -- 
    that is, they convert into an electron-positron pair, interacting with
    an atomic nucleus or electron in order to conserve momentum. 
    High-energy electrons and positrons primarily
    emit photons, a process called *bremsstrahlung*...
    Pair production and bremsstrahlung continue, leading to
    a *cascade* of particles of decreasing energy until phtotons fall below the 
    pair production threshold.

    See the 
    [Wikipedia page on EM showers]
    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_shower#Electromagnetic_showers)

Hadronic shower
    Hadronic showers are produced by hadrons (i.e. nucleons and other particles made of quarks), 
    and proceed mostly via the strong nuclear force.

This is saying that at lower energies, the $\tau$ channel can see better.

## Radio Detection Platforms

> "...larger aperature generally comes at the price of a higher threshold..."

ie. "Threshold" below which we cannot detect.
