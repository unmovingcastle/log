```{glossary}
Beam-forming trigger
    Also known as *phased-array* trigger. The basic idea is that the waveforms
    of different channels are compared (phase-shifted) and then added so that
    noise cancel out while signals from an actual event would add coherently.
    "Beam" basically means "direction" (as in a beam of light).

    For more information, see 
    [this ARA paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04573).
