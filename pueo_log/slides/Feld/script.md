## outline

I'll quickly introduce what the Poisson distribution is in the first section.
Specifically, what we are trying to here is to estimate a parameter of Poisson distribution.

And then we'll talk about how we can report our estimates with uncertainty using CI.
We'll discuss what these are and how to construct them classically.

Next we will see a problem with the standard approach.

The authors propose to construct CI with a small tweak which we won't get to today.
(but it's in the slides)
However, I will compare their CI with the traditional intervals and we'll see why their approach is
more appealing.

The Acceptance Region section is basically a step-by-step guide to constructing their CI, 
and hopefully this is easier to read and understand than the original paper.

For kicks and giggles there's also some Bayesian statistics stuff which we definitely won't have time
to go over but you're welcome to read about it.
One thing worth noting is that in Bayesian statistics there's something known as the Credible Interval,
which is entirely different from what we are talking about today.
