## Meeting with Kaeli, Thursday Feb. 6

### Poisson Error

+   We talked about the {ref}`error bar script <errorbar_script_kaeli>`. Specifically, the
    `poissonerror`s.

```{seealso}
An important paper on this topic: [Feldman and Counsins](https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/9711021.pdf)
```


### tasks
+ [ ] Check if flight path indeed has an impact on the effective area
    + [ ] make simulations with Anita III config (flight path: 9)
            using the latest version of pueosim (Jan '24)
    + [ ] make simulations with Anita IV flight path (flight path: 8)
            using the latest version of pueosim (Jan '24)
    + [x] make simulations with default config (flight path: 0, ie. balloon not moving)
            using the latest version of pueosim (Jan '24)
    + [ ] Plot the effective areas of above three along with the data from Dec.
            '22 that Kaeli sent me.

+ [ ] Go over [Will's util scrtips](https://github.com/PUEOCollaboration/pueoAnalysisTools/tree/main/WillUtils).
