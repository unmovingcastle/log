Beam-forming trigger
    Also known as *phased-array* trigger. The basic idea is that the waveforms
    of different channels are compared (phase-shifted) and then added so that
    noise cancel out while signals from an actual event would add coherently.
    "Beam" basically means "direction" (as in a beam of light).
