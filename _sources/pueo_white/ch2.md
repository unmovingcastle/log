Air shower
    Consider the case where a $\tau$-neutrino gives birth to a $\tau$-lepton in ice, which
    travels for a distance and then decays in air. Charges will be produced in air,
    and because of the magnetic field of the Earth, *geomagnetic emission* takes
    place, and radio signal can be detected by the payload.

    This term also refers to in-air showers caused by cosmic rays, which produce
    radio waves that are horizonally polarized.

Chemical composition at Earth
    Chemical composition [of cosmic rays detected] at Earth.

Steradian
    The [dimensionless] unit of solid angle in SI units,
    much analogous to radian, which quantifies planar angles (Wikipedia).

Uniform source class
    This refers to the assumption that cosmic ray sources are more or less homogeneous in space and in time.
