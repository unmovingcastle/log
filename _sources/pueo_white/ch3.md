# The Radio Detection Technique

## In-Ice Askaryan Emission

```{glossary}
Shower
    In particle physics, a shower is a *cascade* of secondary particles produced
    as the result of a high-energy particle interacting with dense matter (Wikipedia).

* What is the difference between EM showers and hadronic showers?

## Geomagnetic Emission form Air Showers

> "The EAS $\tau$ channel typically has a lower energy threshold than the Askaryan channel. Due to
> the narrow emission cone, the overall aperture is less [?] once the Askaryan channel threshold is
> exceeded."


## Radio Detection Platforms

> "...larger aperature generally comes at the price of a higher threshold..."
