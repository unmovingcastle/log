# Stafford Dissertation Introduction


## The Neutrino
- An electromagnetic shower is initiated when a UHE neutrino traversing matter
  strikes an atomic nucleus, freeing high-energy electron and nuclear
  fragments. Liberated electrons scatter off atoms, emitting photons through
  {term}`bremsstrahlung`. cf. {ref}`Kaeli's Dissertation Ch 1.3 <hughes1.3>`

- These photons in turn scatter against atoms, creating positron-electron pairs
  via {term}`pair-production`, and freeing additional electrons via
  {term}`Compton scattering`

- Subsequent bremsstrahlung emissions and positron-electron annihilations
  produce even more photons. A chain reaction ensures, and a conglomeration of
  positrons and electrons begins to accumulate.

- Compton electrons and positron annihilation leads to a negative charge excess of about 20%
    in the conglomeration.

- The cascade continues until the energy per $e^{\pm}$ falls to about **100
  MeV**. At this point, ionization replaces bremstrahlung as the primary
  stopping mechanism and the shower ceases to develop.

- Neutrino mass: $<10^{-6} \, m_e$

- barn: $10^{-28}$ m; mb: $10^{-31}$ m.

- CC is deep inelastic. NC is elastic. (Figure 1.1 in the thesis)
