    - [ ]

*   - Two. The Standard Model and Neutrino Physics
    - [x]
    - [x]
    - Still not quite familiar with particle physics stuff though

*   - Three. Ultra-High Energy Astroparticle Physics
    - [x]
    - [x]
    - why does photon horizon go back up???

*   - Four. Radio Emission in Ultra-High Energy particle Showers
    - [ ]
    - [ ]
    - 1. where can I find the relation b/w $\nu$ energy and recorded voltages?
      2. better start reading about the math behind cherenkov rad. Jackson? :(
      3. the stuff on radio detection of cosmic ray is pretty obscure but hopefully not
         immediately relevant.
